MULTI THREADING
________________________________________________
THREAD -> SMALLEST INDIVIDUAL UNIT OF A PROGRAM,
PROGRAM -> SET OF INSTRUCTIONS,
PROCESS -> INSTANCE OF A PROGRAM,
CORE PROCESSORS -> QUAD, OCTA,
MULTI THREADING -> MULTIPLE THREADS WORKS TOGETHER TO EXECUTE THE SAME TASK. IT OPERATES AT THREAD LEVEL,
MULTI TASKING -> IT ALLOWS OS TO EXECUTE MULTIPLE PROCESS SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT OPERATES AT LEVEL OF PROCESS,
CONTEXT SWITCHING -> IT IS A STAGE OF STORING CONTEXT OF A PROCESS WHILE EXECUTING ANOTHER PROCESS
PROCESS LIFE CYCLE -> READY, RUNNING, WAITING, TIMED WAITING, TERMINATE, NEW,
NEW -> WHEN THE PROCESS IS CREATED BUT WAITING TO GET EXECUTE AND ITS BEFORE EXECUTING THE RUN METHOD,
READY -> WHEN WE EXECUTE THE RUN METHOD BUT STILL WAITING TO EXECUTE AND MORE THAN ONE PROCESSES CAN STAY HERE AT THE SAME TIME
RUNNING -> WHEN THE PROCESS IS ACTUALLY EXECUTING
WAITING -> WHEN THE PROCESS IS GONE FOR THE IO OPERATIONS
TIMED WAITING -> IT CAN EITHER DUE TO THE LESS SPACE IN THE WAITING QUEUE OR BEAUSE OF PREEMPTION OF PROCESS FROM THE WAITING QUEUE
TERMINATE -> WHEN THE PROCESS IS SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED,
--------------------------------------------------
WHEN THE JAVA PROGRAM RUNS, THEN THE MAIN THREAD IS EXECUTING AT FIRST
Thread.currentThread().getName() - IT IS USED TO GET THE NAME OF THE CURRENT THREAD.
start() : it is used to perform multi threading,
run() : it is used to only define the body to execute but this method is not capable for performing Multi threading,
--------------------------------------------------
Two methods to perform multi threading is :-
By using Thread Class
By using Runnable Interface
--------------------------------------------------
By extending Thread class, start() method is used to perform multi threading
By implementing Runnable Interface then no method is present named start(), then firstly to create object of Thread class by passing the object name inside it then start() method is called
--------------------------------------------------
But the main benefit of using Runnable interface is then as class can be extended at max one but interface can be infinite
